                        registers with us. The parent or guardian which provided consent in accordance with this
                        paragraph shall at all times be permitted (using the contact details set out at the end of this
                        Privacy Policy) to request access to their childâ€™s information, request that any information be
                        deleted and/or refuse to allow any further collection or use of their information.</p>
